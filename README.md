# PyBlackScholes

 In this module, you would define a function that takes the necessary inputs for the Black-Scholes equation (such as the stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility) and returns the solution to the equation. You may also want to include additional functions that are commonly used in options pricing, such as ones for calculating the cumulative standard normal distribution and the d1 and d2 terms in the Black-Scholes formula.
